# Claude + Tmux MCP Server Ideas

## Concept
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that gives Claude deep integration with tmux sessions, enabling sophisticated terminal workspace management and automation.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Session & Window Management
- **Create named sessions** with specific layouts (dev, debug, monitoring)
- **Save/restore session states** - window arrangements, pane sizes, running commands
- **Smart session switching** based on project context
- **Template sessions** for different project types (web dev, data science, devops)

### 2. Intelligent Pane Control
- **Create panes with purpose** - "create a pane for running tests", "split for log monitoring"
- **Resize panes** based on content needs (expand for errors, shrink when idle)
- **Synchronize panes** for multi-server operations
- **Smart pane navigation** - "go to the pane running the server"

### 3. Command Execution & Monitoring
- **Send commands to specific panes** without switching context
- **Monitor command output** across all panes simultaneously
- **Capture output** from background panes for analysis
- **Queue commands** to run sequentially in a pane
- **Parallel execution** - run different commands in multiple panes

### 4. Process Management
- **Track running processes** in each pane
- **Restart failed processes** automatically
- **Kill runaway processes** based on CPU/memory usage
- **Process health monitoring** with alerts

### 5. Development Workflows

#### Web Development Layout
```
┌─────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Editor (nvim)   │ Browser test │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Server logs     │ Dev server   │
├─────────────────┼──────────────┤
│ Git status      │ Test runner  │
└─────────────────┴──────────────┘
```
Claude could:
- Set up this layout automatically
- Route commands to appropriate panes
- Monitor all processes
- Coordinate testing with code changes

#### Debugging Session
- Create debug layout with specific panes for:
  - Code editor
  - Debugger interface
  - Variable watch
  - Log tail
  - REPL/console
- Coordinate breakpoints with pane focus
- Capture state at each breakpoint

### 6. Advanced Features

#### Intelligent Log Monitoring
- Watch multiple log files in different panes
- Highlight errors/warnings
- Correlate logs across services
- Trigger actions on log patterns

#### Distributed Development
- Manage SSH sessions in different panes
- Synchronize deployments across servers
- Monitor multiple environments simultaneously
- Coordinate multi-machine operations

#### Testing Orchestration
- Run unit tests in one pane
- Integration tests in another
- Monitor coverage in third
- Aggregate results and report issues

#### Build Pipeline Visualization
- Each build step in a separate pane
- Visual feedback on success/failure
- Parallel build monitoring
- Resource usage per step

### 7. Claude-Specific Integrations

#### Context Awareness
- Claude knows what's running in each pane
- Can reference output from any pane
- Understands relationships between panes
- Maintains history of pane activities

#### Proactive Assistance
- "I notice your server crashed in pane 2, should I restart it?"
- "The tests are failing in pane 3, here's the error analysis"
- "Your database query in pane 4 is taking unusually long"

#### Workflow Automation
```claude
"Set up my usual development environment"
- Creates standard session layout
- Starts necessary services
- Opens relevant files
- Begins monitoring logs

"Deploy to staging"
- Creates deployment session
- Runs tests in pane 1
- Builds in pane 2
- Deploys in pane 3
- Monitors in pane 4
```

### 8. Implementation Ideas

#### MCP Server Capabilities
```javascript
// Example MCP methods
tmux.createSession({ name: "dev", layout: "tiled" })
tmux.sendToPane({ pane: 2, command: "npm test" })
tmux.capturePane({ pane: 1, lines: 100 })
tmux.monitorProcess({ pane: 3, alert_on: "error" })
tmux.saveLayout({ name: "my-workspace" })
tmux.restoreLayout({ name: "my-workspace" })
```

#### Claude Commands
```
"Create a new tmux session for debugging this Python app"
"Monitor all panes and alert me if any process fails"
"Set up a four-pane layout for full-stack development"
"Capture the last error from the test pane"
"Restart the server in pane 2 with debug flags"
"Save this session layout as 'api-development'"
```

### 9. Safety & Best Practices
- **Confirmation before destructive actions** (killing sessions)
- **Sandbox support** - practice in isolated sessions
- **Undo capabilities** - restore previous layouts
- **Resource limits** - prevent too many panes/sessions
- **Command filtering** - block dangerous commands

### 10. Future Possibilities
- **Visual session designer** - draw layout, Claude creates it
- **Session sharing** - collaborate with team members
- **Recording & playback** - record terminal sessions for debugging
- **AI-powered log analysis** - pattern recognition across panes
- **Predictive layouts** - suggest layouts based on project type
- **Cross-machine tmux** - manage tmux on remote servers

## Benefits for Developers

1. **Reduced context switching** - Claude manages the workspace
2. **Automated environment setup** - consistent dev environments
3. **Better debugging** - coordinated multi-pane debugging
4. **Improved monitoring** - AI watching all processes
5. **Workflow optimization** - Claude learns your patterns
6. **Documentation** - Claude understands your entire workspace state

## Challenges to Consider

1. **State management** - tracking what's in each pane
2. **Performance** - monitoring multiple panes efficiently
3. **Security** - safe command execution
4. **Compatibility** - different tmux versions/configs
5. **Learning curve** - users need to understand capabilities

## MVP Features

Start simple with:
1. Create/list/switch sessions
2. Send commands to specific panes
3. Capture pane output
4. Save/restore layouts
5. Basic process monitoring

Then expand based on user needs.

This MCP server would transform tmux from a terminal multiplexer into an AI-powered development command center, where Claude acts as your intelligent workspace manager.
